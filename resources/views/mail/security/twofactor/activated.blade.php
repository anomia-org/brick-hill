Hey there, <b>{{ $user->username }}</b><br>
Thanks for activating Two Factor Authentication. This will make sure that you are the only person who can ever get into your account.
<br><br>
Be warned though that if you ever lose access to the app where the token is stored, or to the backup recovery codes you have saved, your account may not be recoverable.

Happy Hilling!<br>
