The Two Factor Authentication recovery codes for your account {{ $user->username }} have been reset. 
If this wasn't you, change your password in the <a href="{{ config('site.url') }}/settings">settings</a> page.
<br><br>
Make sure to use a secure and memorable password, and never give out your Two Factor Authentication codes.

Happy Hilling!<br>
